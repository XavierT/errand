# errand
toy rust project


#Installation

The project is linked against the Ncurses library, using the thin wrapper from https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs .
So you need lib ncurses installed on your system to build.

On Ubuntu, install rust/cargo (tested with rust 1.12)

1. sudo aptitude install libncursesw5-dev
2. git clone https://github.com/XavierT/errand.git
3. cargo run
